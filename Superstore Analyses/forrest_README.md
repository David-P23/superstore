# Global Superstore Data

## Group Topic & Data Source
We plan on using [Superstore Data Sets](https://data.world/tableauhelp/superstore-data-sets), found on data.world for our analysis. At this time, we don't anticipate needing any other data sources. In our analysis, we ultimately hope to quantify, visualize, and predict the success of this global superstore by examining the orders and returns received 2012 - 2015.

## Hypothesis
We intend to identify highly profitable products, geographic locations, customers, market segments, and timeframes. We also want to identify the products and customers that result in high return rates in effort to reduce associated expenses.

## Approach
Currently, we plan on heavily using Pandas, as well as MatPlotLib. Down the line, we do plan on using both supervised and unsupervised machine learning. Supervised ML would involve predicting specific items and orders that will be returned, while unsupervised ML would involve clustering the orders by something like profit. We do plan on storing this data in an SQL database.

My section to include or not(still working on it):
After our group decided on moving forward with the superstore sales data, the initial steps involved data cleaning and basic exploring of the dataset. This was done using python in jupyter notebook and evaluating the data in a pandas dataframe. We found the dataset to contain some interesting characteristics and features including returns
